This is an ASP.Net Web API 2 solution I wrote up for a company as part of 
their interview process. And since I'm not sure whether or not I should 
broadcase their name to the world, I'm leaving that out. At least for now.

I was only given ~5 hours to do this, so yes, there are LOTS of things missing. That said, I belive I got the bulk of the architecture that I use for my Web API projects these days in there.

(Sorry for the nick name, but I don't think I ever expected to use this for
'work related' stuff when I first created my GitHub account. ..as cray cray as that sounds now of course.)  ;)
